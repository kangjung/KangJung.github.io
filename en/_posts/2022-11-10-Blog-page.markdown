Upon registration, I received a meal ticket and a name tag together...

## Keynote Speeches
![기조연설](https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FckzuIg%2FbtrQJPN4pcA%2FTDKMpQQJFlwT5R7L29BT6k%2Fimg.png){:data-align="center"}

The keynote speech in the morning was generally about the open-source industry.


**The Present and Future of Artificial Intelligence Technology** was a presentation about national strategies in the field of artificial intelligence, such as the digital platform government, the background of the AI technology industry, and trends in AI technology. While it's important to consider the source algorithms of AI, I also thought about the importance of services utilizing that technology. There were contents about overcoming current AI limitations such as lack of learning ability, reliability, and usability through various researches, and directions for AI development. Although my interest in AI itself isn't very high, it was a time that made me recall memories of attending major courses.


**Growth Strategy of Open Source and Cloud Ecosystem**explained that in our country, we are still at an early stage, just using open source. It was a presentation where I could understand the explanation about open source.

**The Future and Response of Interaction between Open Source and Industry** had similar content to the previous presentation, but it was a presentation that I focused on the most during the morning because the presenter spoke interestingly.

## Lunch

After listening to the morning keynote speeches, there was a place exchanging commemorative items with the voucher given in the morning. The souvenir was a small umbrella, which seems good to carry in bags. With the meal ticket, I could eat at nearby restaurants, and I just ate Bacon Fried Rice at Dimdimdeok, the closest restaurant. The Stir-fried Tea Leaves were delicious.

## Sessions
### 공개 SW R&D 과제 현황 및 지원방안(Status and Support Plan of Public SW R&D Projects)
![세션1](https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FVP4JB%2FbtrQOnEB2hF%2FxQkQUGXNKK59bM2rBXAsKK%2Fimg.png){:data-align="center"}

The presentation on the status and support plan of public SW R&D projects talked about expanding roles in the software field, explanations about open source, and the current status of projects being conducted by the Information and Communications Planning Evaluation Institute, as well as regulations related to public SW. They mentioned they will create and distribute guidelines for practical execution of public SW. It wasn’t anything different, but it was something I vaguely heard a few years ago at work. It wasn’t just business talk; it emphasized the importance of communities. If there is support for communities in national projects, active open source development might be possible. It seemed more helpful for companies than general developers like me.

### 출연연 오픈소스 R&D 전략(Open Source R&D Strategy of Research Institutes)
![세션2](https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cbOvT5/btrQPErTrnP/GobrufkHrAILw2Mk8NKk01/img.png){:data-align="center"}

It was said that internal awareness of open source R&D has changed a lot. To properly implement open source compliance, the will of the head of the institution, continuous interest, and the operation of a dedicated organization are necessary. The direction of the RD performance model business model, supply chain system, and advanced compliance service were important. However, it wasn’t very relatable. The idea of creating a platform for RD collaboration culture to make continuous support and collaboration easy resonated with me. In government projects or public projects, many projects exist without knowing their existence due to poor management, and there are often no responses to PR. The presentation showed what ETRI is currently doing and governance of open source. They develop, operate, and support systems like OLA, collaboration platforms, etc., and seem to be researching various things in collaboration with government departments and related institutions. They want to contribute to the open source ecosystem through various activities, including providing know-how of open source governance of research institutes.

### 글로벌 오픈소스 동향(Global Trends of Open Source)

There was a saying that software eats the world, and in 2013, the phrase “Open Source is eating Software” appeared. Although the utilization rate of open source is increasing, there is also a risk of security issues, and the commercialization of open source is growing rapidly. The presentation also discussed changes in corporate work due to the expansion of open source influence.

### sw교육을 위한 피지컬 코딩 교육용 에듀 메이커 보드(Physical Coding Education Board for SW Education)
![세션3](https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bboLcT/btrQJpaZhEm/I61iFx8PjFoY6laHgeErl1/img.jpg){:data-align="center"}

The presenter was the principal of Daejeon Industrial Information High School. I remember hearing a lot of stories from people around me when I heard that software education would become mandatory. I saw the educational textbook through the presentation ppt, and indeed, there were contents like infrared sensors and motors for elementary students, but since teachers were not familiar with them, proper education was not happening, leading to the creation of this board. Most of the time, only theory was taught until the end of the year, and sensor manipulation education was included, but it coincided with final exams, so it often ended indifferently. You can learn the textbook content in an hour from sites like Code.org and Entry. There were too many educational boards, causing confusion for inexperienced teachers trying to lead, so a board that could be used commonly across elementary, middle, and high school grades was needed. They tried various things for actual education, which looked cool. They share documents on extension boards for input/output, educational materials, textbooks, and content. They gave away boards through a lottery, but unfortunately, I wasn't lucky.

### 공개 딥러닝 모델 활용법(How to Use Public Deep Learning Models)
![세션4](https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/peJKk/btrQK8zlCmO/Q2m9kPkn5tKwbSG4A7u04k/img.jpg){:data-align="center"}

Due to the need to analyze both overseas research and our own research, the workload increased, and to solve this, deep learning was utilized for information collection. For collaboration with NREL, information was collected to analyze research areas of KIER and NREL and identify possible collaboration fields. It was also used for summarizing web documents for report writing, and the presentation explained how it was utilized.

### 오픈스택으로 알아보는 글로벌 커뮤니티의 개발 문화(Development Culture of Global Community through OpenStack)
![세션5](https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bMroEg/btrQJhYzGeG/KxshkIzloiaS6K39aVYLvK/img.jpg){:data-align="center"}

The presentation explained the structure of the OpenStack global community (project teams, SIGs, etc.), roles within the OpenStack community, the philosophy of the Open Infrastructure community, DevStack, tools used (OpenDev, Gerrit, Launchpad, etc.). If you're interested, it's best to check the detailed content on the Open Infrastructure website.

### 리눅스 커널 오픈소스와 kakao icloud(Linux Kernel Open Source and Kakao iCloud)

This was the only remote presentation among all presentations, about the open source used in Kakao iCloud. Due to the remote nature, the speaker’s words were too fast, making it hard to concentrate on-site, and I missed a lot of content. Each presentation seemed to be allocated about 20 minutes, but it finished quickly in about 9 minutes.

### 자동화와 함께하는 오픈소스(Open Source with Automation)
![세션6](https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/peJKk/btrQK8zlCmO/Q2m9kPkn5tKwbSG4A7u04k/img.jpg){:data-align="center"}

With unintentionally growing open source, there are many tasks for humans (code requests, PR reviews, bugs, features, etc.), and although solutions have been created since the past, new issues (Linux kernel license change failure, MIT dominance era) have arisen. The presentation shared experiences on how these problems were automated, such as monolithic repository development, GitHub-based operations, using GitHub Actions, simplifying contribution processes (getting contributor agreement in advance, automating assignment of responsible persons, etc.), and GitHub Codespaces. The presenter’s tone was pleasant, making it enjoyable to listen to.

### 개방형 오픈소스 SW 컴플라이언스 체계 구축 및 공급망 관리(Building Open Source SW Compliance System and Supply Chain Management)
![세션7](https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2Fteyor%2FbtrQKCm7ViU%2FSyUTK3qqjQBwEMzgkRwuPk%2Fimg.jpg){:data-align="center"}

Finally, the panel discussion was on building an open source SW compliance system and managing the supply chain. It was a time to understand the significance of organizations managing open source and relevant laws. Copyrights and patents have exclusive rights, and licenses allow this exclusivity. Violating an open source license can result in fines or other issues, and managing these aspects is called open source governance or compliance. There was also a discussion on security issues in open source, particularly the Log4j issue that affected our company, making it memorable. License violations can impact a company’s reputation, so these parts are managed. The presentation also mentioned planning internal events to contribute to open source and ensuring reliability for customer safety. Legal disputes over licenses occur even when distributing internally, and Samsung Electronics conducts regular inspections of internal systems (many companies might be violating this). There was also a tendency to trust the internal network too much, and while external networks apply updates well, many use outdated programs in internal networks. Our company doesn’t have a separate open source-related team; individual developers manage it themselves. Still, it’s necessary to grasp the status of open sources used in the internal network. When first entering the open source compliance field, accessing materials provided by projects like OpenChain can be helpful. Also, in SI project inspections, newly created sources are verified, but open sources are often overlooked, leading to issues after deployment. Various other topics were covered, including open source tools (LG Electronics Pose Lite, Samsung Real-time Verification Tool, etc.) and software supply chains.

## Conclusion

In the final raffle, I hoped for an iPad but got a Starbucks card instead. The conference content was more beneficial for companies or managers rather than developers. It had been almost three years since I attended an offline conference, almost like the last one in 2019, so just being there was fun.
