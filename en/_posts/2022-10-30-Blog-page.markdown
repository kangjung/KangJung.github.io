## WOOWACON 2022
On October 19, 2022, the WOOWACON 2022 took place. As it was held on a weekday, it overlapped with work hours, which was somewhat disappointing. However, except for the live talk concert, the presentation videos were available in an open format, allowing me to watch interesting videos during commutes or after work. Although the live broadcast's atmosphere is the best, and offline would be even better...

In any case, I've listened to it like radio while working in the past, and this time too, I watched some of the videos. Here, I want to briefly write about the memorable sessions I watched.

The topic of technical debt from the keynote on the first day made me think a lot. The keynote, along with the code review-related video on the third day, emphasized shared culture, development blogs, and code review culture. It's something envious but challenging to achieve in small companies. Introducing such a culture in an already rigid organizational culture with unfamiliar developers and managers seems difficult. Perhaps that's why the videos about the development team's culture stood out more to me.


## Memorable Sessions
### 1. 기획자님들! 개발자가 아키텍처에 집착하는 이유, 쉽게 알려드립니다
![세션1](https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FlgfGz%2FbtrPQ37Z78D%2FkyFPBmLS735bO5dX3L0wx1%2Fimg.png){:data-align="center"}

Made Easy to Understand: This session explained the importance of architecture in a simple way. Even among developers, many do not know the exact concept. Although I understand the concept, I have little experience applying it in practice. In the company, most of what I see are hierarchical and monolithic architectures rather than microservice or clean architectures. This presentation was good for both planners and developers.

### 2. 이런 건 누가 할까? 배민 앱의 그레이존! 크고 작은 싱크홀 메꾸기
![세션2](https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FvjwoT%2FbtrPRAdpZif%2F5JfUlpc11nVEV3Nq7bo2Dk%2Fimg.png){:data-align="center"}

The topic was interesting, and the content was enjoyable. There are gray zones in our company as well, and many office workers know them but pretend not to see them. If I mention it, it becomes my task, but they don't reduce my original work. I often ignored critical issues unless they seemed simple. The presentation reminded me of the past.

### 3. 고품격 Kotlin 개발: 테스트 코드를 우아하게 작성하는 방법
![세션3](https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FbdOP43%2FbtrPTkVISZf%2FCmriK33YXgMF1BCz0YGD51%2Fimg.png){:data-align="center"}

This session introduced writing test codes using Kotest and MockKito. Although I am interested in Kotlin, I haven't used it in actual work. Most of the existing company projects are based on Java + Spring. However, using the Kotest + MockKito combination shown in the video seems to improve readability and productivity. I also learned about the advantages of Kotest.

## Conclusion

Although I watched various other videos, these were the most memorable ones. They might be more memorable due to my experiences and interests, but personally, I found the video on the gray zone the most interesting. The content from the presenters' experiences was particularly engaging, and it was nice to see topics on design and planning that I hadn't thought about before.

Overall, I had a good time at WOOWACON 2022. While I hope it will be offline next time, the fact that multiple videos opened at specific times allowed me to watch only what I needed, which was convenient. Of course, the live keynotes on YouTube were great, but if other videos also had real-time chat and Q&A functions, it might have been even more enjoyable. Still, it was a satisfying time overall.

I fortunately won both the comment event and the post contest at WOOWACON 2022.

Comment Event Prize: A welcome tea set, which included a long-sleeve t-shirt, black tea, and stickers. I initially thought it was a short-sleeve t-shirt, but it turned out to be a warm tea set.

Post Contest Prize: The highly anticipated keyboard and mouse. I expected a full-array keyboard, but the MX Mechanical Mini arrived instead.
