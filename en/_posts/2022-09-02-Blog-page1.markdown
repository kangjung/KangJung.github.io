On March 28, 2022, through July 31, 2022, I received a certificate of appreciation and a power bank as a commemorative gift for participating in the [2022 e-Government Standard Framework Contribution.](https://open.egovframe.org/oc/support/noticeItem.do?nttId=20042&pageIndex=3)

At work, we use egov due to requirements, but I haven't really used the functions or common components of the e-government properly. It's more like adding just a bit of flavor... Anyway, the contribution event that I participated in last year was also held this year, and at that time, I just passed by thinking, "Oh, there's something like this." But this time, I dipped my toes in a little.


![GIT 잔디](https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FcHYBsg%2FbtrLaCteF6e%2FuuhcPIRuOeaOSFXda1xZ70%2Fimg.png){:data-align="center"}

There were no responses to issues or tasks, but I submitted two simple typo corrections as Pull Requests to two different projects each. When I actually tried to do it, I made excuses about not having enough time, so I only dipped my toes in. Since everyone gets a commemorative gift even if you submit one issue or pull request, I now think I should have done it better. If I participate again next year, I will try harder.
