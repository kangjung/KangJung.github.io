## U Day Seoul
![U Day Seoul](https://kangjung.github.io/assets/img/posts/20240522/240522_01.png){:data-align="center"}

On May 22, 2024, we attended U Day Seoul, which covered various topics related to Unity engines. Game developers and engineers were able to gather to listen to their experiences and knowledge.
Below is a review of the main lecture content and impressive points.

### Unity 6, 그 이후: Unity 엔진 및 서비스 로드맵

Explained how Unity supports the development of mixed reality (MR) content.
PolySpaces links Unity and Apple reality kits to deliver rendering information, and suggested a way for existing developers to easily develop MR content for Vision OS.

### Unity 6과 함께 모바일, VR, PC, 콘솔에서 고화질 그래픽 구현

A lecture on VFX graphs and improvements to new lighting and physical collision systems discussed performance optimization and realistic visual effects implementation.
In particular, I remember that the new 6-way lighting and adaptive lighting system were able to improve the environmental effects in the game.

### Dave, a 2D-Diver in a 3D-Land - 데이브 더 다이버 포스트모템

Through the problem of colliders and the development of automation systems in a 2D-3D mixed environment, we were able to increase the quality and efficiency of the game

### 인디게임 산나비 포스트모템
It was a lecture that honestly shared the failure and improvement process in game development. Emphasizing the importance of operation and storytelling, I felt the need for continuous improvement reflecting user feedback.


### Unity Sentis 상세 기술 설명과 게임 콘텐츠 적용 튜토리얼

![Sentis](https://kangjung.github.io/assets/img/posts/20240522/240522_05.png){:data-align="center"}

**Sentis** is Unity's engine that supports on-device AI inference, a technology that enables AI models to run locally without a server.
It was impressive to be able to efficiently apply AI features on various platforms by utilizing the ONNX format.

### 모바일과 XR을 위한, URP 쉐이더 그래프 튜토리얼
The process of using the shader graph to implement the scene transition effect was interesting. I was able to learn how to use the shader graph intuitively by practicing the dissolved and triplan effects.

## Conclusion
At this U Day Seoul, we were able to get a lot of insight into Unity's latest technologies and future developments.
It was an opportunity to learn a new approach to game development, and I'm looking forward to seeing how Unity's features will revolutionize game development and content production in the future.
