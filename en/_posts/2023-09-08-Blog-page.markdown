## SEF2023 (Software Education Festival)

Organized by the NAVER Connect Foundation, [SEF2023](https://sef.connect.or.kr/2023) took place from September 6th to 8th, 2023, and was a successful event dedicated to software education. The festival offered digital goodies like wallpapers and digital calendars for download through pre-registration, although personally, I didn’t find much need for them. Given that SEF’s theme centered on students and education, it wasn’t directly applicable to those with several years of development experience seeking immediate professional enhancement. However, it served as a valuable opportunity to raise awareness about IT education.

For individuals like me, who have been working in development for a few years, the sessions weren’t directly aligned with our day-to-day tasks. Nonetheless, it was beneficial to gain insights into the experiences and perspectives of developers and educators, aspects that aren’t typically explored in regular work contexts. Each session, though briefly noted, was more of a title-level summary, as I listened while working or commuting.

Since the sessions are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@NAVER_CONNECT/videos), anyone interested can revisit them. The content was accessible, not overly technical, making it suitable for beginners or students. The videos, primarily in interview format, gave off a somewhat educational broadcast vibe, akin to EBS or a corporate training video.

Overall, SEF2023 aimed to inspire and inform the next generation of IT professionals, emphasizing the importance of software education and providing a platform for sharing experiences and knowledge.

## DAY 1 당신도 배울 수 있습니다

### 경제학과 출신, 네이버 자율주행 개발자 되다.
The first session narrated the journey of an individual transitioning from an economics background to becoming a developer in autonomous driving at Naver. Listening to their story was truly inspiring, showcasing determination and passion.

### 110만 명 유저 진저호텔을 만든 대학생 5인의 정체는?
This session covered the insights gained during the creation and operation of Ginger Hotel. It resonated with the fear of participating in hackathons and similar events, prompting reflection on missed opportunities during school days. The achievement of developing a widely recognized product was truly commendable.

### 코딩과 전통문화가 만나면?
The third session, presented by a high school student, explored the intersection of coding and traditional culture. The enthusiasm and unique approach to defining one’s development style were impressive.

### 전직 영어 교사의 100만 명 코딩 학습 사이트 창업기
This segment shared the story of an educator who started a coding learning site. It included recommendations for learning development, thoughts on GPT, and the evolving role of developers. The speaker addressed concerns about coders being replaced by AI, expressing that developers stand to benefit the most. Their perspective reassured that the pace of AI development does not warrant immediate concern.

### 닫힌 기술을 여는 예술 : 기술 장벽 허물기
The final session focused on the activities and mission of the Tech Lab, aiming to dismantle barriers associated with technology. It introduced novel concepts like tech criticism magazines and sewn circuit boards, highlighting efforts beyond conventional development realms.

## DAY 2 AI와 함께 하는 성장

### AI에 진심인 네이버, 어떻게 다를까?
This session emphasized the importance of building Korea’s AI ecosystem. It was enlightening to learn that Korea ranks higher in AI than I initially thought and to understand Naver’s contributions to the AI field. Comparing AI to nuclear power was particularly striking, and the engaging storytelling kept the session lively and enjoyable, especially as I had recently joined CLOVA X.

### 빌 게이츠가 극찬한 미국 칸 아카데미의 GPT
This session provided a brief history of online edtech and the journey of Khan Academy, followed by insights into the development of Khanmigo. It explored the vision of Khanmigo as an AI tutor and its potential applications, offering practical examples.


### GPT와 사랑에 빠진 대표님이 말하는 Chat AI AskUp 이야기
The speaker shared experiences creating learning plans using GPT and outlined three principles for experimenting with GPT Applications: relevance to current tasks, choosing fun activities, and opting for tasks where minor errors are acceptable. Several technologies developed by Upstage using GPT were introduced, demonstrating practical applications.


### 교수님이 직접 들려주는 ChatGPT로 A+ 받는 법
The session transitioned from the era of searching through Wikipedia and Google to the current age of GPT-driven information. It discussed the educational benefits and limitations of ChatGPT, including examples of responses to essay and multiple-choice questions in both Korean and English. The speaker underscored the importance of recognizing GPT’s strengths and weaknesses and highlighted the need for ethical guidelines concerning copyright, plagiarism, and privacy.


### 데이터 사이언티스트 되고 싶다면? 현직자가 알려줄게!
This session provided insights for non-majors entering the data analysis field and explained the role of a data scientist. However, lacking personal interest in the topic, my retention of the session’s content was minimal.

## DAY3 세상이 변하면 우리도 변해야 하니까
### 멘티에서 멘토가 되는 개발자 문화
The session shared the journey of becoming a mentor, including the motivations behind starting mentoring activities, the experiences gained, and the importance of staying updated with new technologies and news. It also discussed the culture of sharing within the developer community and strategies for strengthening skills. Providing feedback, especially to junior colleagues, is something I often find challenging, and hearing about mentors’ approaches was inspiring.

### 교실에서의 AI, 바르게 교육하려면?
An interview with a professor researching AI focused on AI ethics, explaining it in an accessible manner. It was surprising to learn that children under 13 cannot use OpenAI without adult supervision, a fact only revealed in this video. The inclusion of digital literacy and AI ethics in the curriculum starting from 2025 was also new information.

### 교육 선진국 핀란드의 행복한 AI 교육법

### 엔트리의 10주년, 그 성장과 함께 한 사람들
The session featured stories of people involved with Entry over the past decade. While I previously viewed tools like Entry and Scratch merely as educational, hearing firsthand accounts revealed their broader potential. Compared to my own late introduction to coding in university, today’s younger, creative learners seem poised for even greater success. The evolution of educational approaches in Korea appears more robust and helpful than I assumed.
